## Typing stubs for boto

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `boto` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `boto`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/boto. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `ef5b4b6820ba7638d4749e9642a1d4bc2bc95707`.
