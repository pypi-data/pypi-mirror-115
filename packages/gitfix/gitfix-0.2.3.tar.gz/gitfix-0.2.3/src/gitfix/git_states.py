`git log --grep foo --all` where `foo` is replaced with something unique in the \
commits you made. You can also search with `gitk --all --date-order` to see \
if anything looks likely.

Check your stashes, `git stash list`, to see if you might have stashed instead \
of committing. You can also visualize what the stashes might be associated with via:

```bash
gitk --all --date-order $(git stash list | awk -F: '{print $1};')
```

Next, you should probably look in other repositories you have lying around \
including ones on other hosts and in testing environments, and in your backups.

Once you are fully convinced that it is well and truly lost, you can start \
looking elsewhere in git. Specifically, you should first look at the reflog \
which contains the history of what happened to the tip of your branches for \
the past two weeks or so. You can of course say `git log -g` or `git reflog` \
to view it, but it may be best visualized with:

```bash
gitk --all --date-order $(git reflog --pretty=%H)
```

Next you can look in git's lost and found. Dangling commits get generated \
for many good reasons including resets and rebases. Still those activities \
might have mislaid the commits you were interested in. These might be best \
visualized with:

```bash
gitk --all --date-order $(git fsck | grep "dangling commit" | awk '{print $3;}')
```

The last place you can look is in dangling blobs. These are files which have \
been git added but not attached to a commit for some (usually innocuous) \
reason. To look at the files, one at a time, run:

```bash
git fsck | grep "dangling blob" | while read x x s; do
  git show $s | less;
done
```

Once you find the changes you are interested in, there are several ways you \
can proceed. You can `git reset --hard SHA` your current branch to the history \
and current state of that SHA (probably not recommended for stashes), you can \
`git branch newbranch SHA` to link the old history to a new branch name (also \
not recommended for stashes), you can `git stash apply SHA` (for the non-index \
commit in a git-stash), you can `git stash merge SHA` or `git cherry-pick SHA` \
(for either part of a stash or non-stashes), etc."""

`git stash list` and decide whether to `git stash drop` them after some time \

default. See `--include-untracked` and `--all` for stash options to handle \
those two cases.

However, perhaps you are confident enough to know for sure that you will \
never ever want the uncommitted changes. If so, you can run `git reset --hard`\
, however please be quite aware that this is almost certainly a completely \
unrecoverable operation. Any changes which are removed here cannot be restored \
later. This will not delete untracked or ignored files. Those can be deleted \
with `git clean -nd` and `git clean -ndX` respectively, or `git clean -ndx` for \
both at once. Well, actually those command do not delete the files. They \
show what files will be deleted. Replace the "n" in "-nd…" with "f" to \

commits) you want to move (those values are the same if you are moving only \
one commit), the name of the branch you are moving the commit from, and the \
name of the branch you are moving the commit to. In the example below, these \
four values will be named $first, $last, $source, and $destination \
(respectively). Additionally, you will need to use a nonce branch as a \
placeholder. The nonce branch will be called "nonce" in the following \
example. However, you may use any branch name that is not currently in use. \
You can delete it immediately after you are done.

```bash
git branch nonce $last
git rebase -p --onto $destination $first^ nonce
```

Remember that when you substitute $first in the command above, leave the \
`^` alone, it is literal.

Use `gitk --all --date-order` to check to make sure the move looks correct \
(pretending that nonce is the destination branch). Please check very \
carefully if you were trying to move a merge, it may have been recreated \
improperly. If you don't like the result, you may delete the nonce branch \
(`git branch -D nonce`) and try again.

However, if everything looks good, we can move the actual destination branch \
pointer to where nonce is:

```bash
git checkout $destination
git reset --hard nonce
git branch -d nonce
```

If you double-checked with `gitk --all --date-order`, you would see that the \
destination branch looks correct. However, the commits are still on the \
source branch as well. We can get rid of those now:

```bash
git rebase -p --onto $first^ $last $source
```

Using `gitk --all --date-order` one last time, you should now see that the \
commits on the source branch have gone away. You have successfully moved the \
commits. Please check very carefully if merges occurred after the commits \
which were deleted. They may have been recreated incorrectly. If so you can \
either undo the delete or try to delete the bad merge and try to recreate it \

Perhaps you should run `git stash save -p "description"` instead and select \
the changes you no longer want to be stashed, instead of permanently removing \
them.

Oh dear. This is going to get a little complicated. It should all work out, though. You will need to use a nonce branch as a placeholder. I will call the nonce branch "nonce" in the following example. However, you may use any branch name that is not currently in use. You can delete it immediately after you are done.

- Identify the SHA of the commit you wish to modify.

You can do this using `gitk --date-order` or using `git log --graph --decorate --oneline`. You are looking for the 40 character SHA-1 hash ID (or the 7 character abbreviation). Yes, if you know the "^" or "~" shortcuts you may use those.

- Remember the name of the branch you are currently on.

The line with a star on it in the `git branch` output is the branch you are currently on. I will use "$master" in this example, but substitute your branch name for "$master" in the following commands.

- Create and checkout a nonce branch pointing at that commit.

```bash
git checkout -b nonce SHA
```

Replace `SHA` with the reference you want to modify.

- Modify the commit

You need to get the index into the correct state you wish the commit to reflect. If you are changing the file contents, typically you would modify the working directory and use `git add` as normal. If you are changing the commit message only, you don't need to do anything before moving on to the next step.

Note if you wish to restore a file to a known good state, you can use `git checkout GOODSHA -- path/to/filename`.

Once the index is in the correct state, then you can run `git commit --amend` to update the last commit. Yes, you can use `-a` if you want to avoid the git add suggested in the previous paragraph.

If the commit you are updating is a merge commit, ensure that the log message reflects that.

- Put the remaining commits after the new one you just created

Remembering to substitute the correct branch name for $master

```bash
git rebase -p --onto $(git rev-parse nonce) HEAD^ $master
```

- Validate that the topology is still good

If some of the commits after the commit you changed are merge commits, please be warned. It is possible that `git rebase -p` will be unable to properly recreate them. Please inspect the resulting merge topology using `gitk --date-order HEAD ORIG_HEAD` to ensure that git did want you wanted. If it did not, there is not really any automated recourse. You can reset back to the commit before the SHA you want to get rid of, and then cherry-pick the normal commits and manually re-merge the "bad" merges. Or you can just suffer with the inappropriate topology (perhaps creating fake merges `git merge --ours otherbranch` so that subsequent development work on those branches will be properly merged in with the correct merge-base).

- Delete the nonce branch

You don't need it. It was just there to communicate an SHA between two steps in the above process. `git branch -d nonce`"""

If a fast-forward (ff) merge occurred you only have simple commits, so should \
use another method.

Oh dear. This is going to get complicated.

To create an positive commit to remove the effects of a merge commit, you must \
first identify the SHA of the commit you want to revert. You can do this using \
`gitk --date-order` or using `git log --graph --decorate --oneline`. You are \
looking for the 40 character SHA-1 hash ID (or the 7 character abbreviation). \
Yes, if you know the `^` or `~` shortcuts you may use those.

Undoing the file modifications caused by the merge is about as simple as you \
might hope. `git revert -m 1 SHA`. (Obviously replace `SHA` with the reference \
you want to revert; `-m 1` will revert changes from all but the first parent, \
which is almost always what you want.) Unfortunately, this is just the tip of \
the iceberg. The problem is, what happens months later, long after you have \
exiled this problem from your memory, when you try again to merge these branches \
(or any other branches they have been merged into)? Because git has it tracked \
in history that a merge occurred, it is not going to attempt to remerge what it \
has already merged. Even worse, if you merge from the branch where you did the \
revert, you will undo the changes on the branch where they were made. (Imagine \
you revert a premature merge of a long-lived topic branch into master, and later \
merge master into the topic branch to get other changes for testing.)

One option is actually to do this reverse merge immediately, annihilating any \
changes before the bad merge, and then to "revert the revert" to restore them. \
This leaves the changes removed from the branch you mistakenly merged to, but \
present on their original branch, and allows merges in either direction without \
loss. This is the simplest option, and in many cases, can be the best.

A disadvantage of this approach is that `git blame` output is not as useful \
(all the changes will be attributed to the revert of the revert) and `git bisect` \
is similarly impaired. Another disadvantage is that you must merge all current \
changes in the target of the bad merge back into the source; if your development \
style is to keep branches clean, this may be undesirable, and if you rebase your \
branches (e.g. with `git pull --rebase`), it could cause complications unless you \
are careful to use `git rebase -p` to preserve merges.

In the following example, please replace `$destinatio`n with the name of the \
branch that was the destination of the bad merge, `$source` with the name of \
the branch that was the source of the bad merge, and `$sha` with the SHA-1 hash \
ID of the bad merge itself.

```bash
git checkout $destination
git revert $sha
# save the SHA-1 of the revert commit to un-revert it later
revert="git rev-parse HEAD"
git checkout $source
git merge $destination
git revert $revert
```

Another option is to abandon the branch you merged from, recreate it from the \
previous merge-base with the commits since then rebased or cherry-picked over, \
and use the recreated branch from now on. Then the new branch is unrelated and \
will merge properly. Of course, if you have pushed the donor branch, you cannot \
use the same name (that would be rewriting public history and is bad) so everyone \
needs to remember to use the new branch.

This approach has the advantage that the recreated donor branch will have cleaner \
history, but especially if there have been many commits (and especially merges) \
to the branch, it can be a lot of work. At this time, I will not walk you through \
the process of recreating the donor branch. \
See https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/revert-a-faulty-merge.txthowto/revert-a-faulty-merge.txt \
