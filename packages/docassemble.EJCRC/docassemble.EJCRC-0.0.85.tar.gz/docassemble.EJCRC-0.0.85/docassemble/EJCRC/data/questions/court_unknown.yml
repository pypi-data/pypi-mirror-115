  Whatâ€™s the difference between an ejectment and landlord/tenant appeal?

  An ejectment is a legal action that can be used by a property owner to remove an occupant from the property when there is no landlord-tenant relationship between the property owner and occupant.  Ejectment cases can only be filed in the Court of Common Pleas.

  A landlord-tenant appeal is a legal action that can be taken to ask the Court of Common Pleas to review the decision of Municipal Court.
