Panoramix
=========

This is an EVM decompiler.

It's is a fork of the Panoramix repo by Palkeo (https://github.com/palkeo/panoramix) which is a fork of the original repo that's not maintained actively by its author anymore: https://github.com/eveem-org/panoramix.git

The goal of this fork is to maintain Panoramix in a decent shape, fix some crashes, implement missing opcodes...
I also got rid of the "tilde" syntax that was using a custom python encoding and use vanilla Python instead. And I made it a proper python package that can be imported.
There is also a better support of timeouts, as instead of stopping entirely we will fallback and print whatever we decompiled even if it's not complete.

The code quality is still not great and the software is complex, it's mostly reserved for advanced users.

## Installation

```console
$ pip install panoramix-decompiler-abi
```

## Running

You will need to specify a web3 provider using the environment variable `WEB3_PROVIDER_URI`. In this case a local provider was set.

```unix
$ WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=http://localhost:7545 panoramix 0x0d94D81FD712126E7f320b5B10537D01d6a01563
```

The following options are available (--profile only with a single address)

```console
$ python panoramix [address|shortcut|address,address|bytecode] [func_name] [--abi] [--verbose] [--silent] [--profile]

# address example:
$ python panoramix 0x0d94D81FD712126E7f320b5B10537D01d6a01563 --abi --silent

# bytecode example:
$ python panoramix 6004600d60003960046000f30011223344 --abi --silent
```

## Examples

I have decompiled all of mainnet, and make sure to decompile again on the latest Panoramix version from time to time.
