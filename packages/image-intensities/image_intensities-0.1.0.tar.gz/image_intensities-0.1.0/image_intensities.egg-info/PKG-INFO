Description: # image_intensities
        Python implementation of the great [derpibooru/image_intensities](https://github.com/derpibooru/image_intensities/tree/8aa43674f61f77cfc756c23556b6ae45e1b210b1).
        
        > The algorithmic overview is to convert the image into the yuv colorspace, drop the u and v components, 
        > and then average the y component over 4 evenly-spaced rectangles on the image dimensions.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```python
        from image_intensities import png_intensities, jpg_intensities, image_intensities, Intensities
        
        # Let's calculate some values
        luma_a = png_intensities('/absolute/path/to/954482.png')  # image can ge found in the tests folder.
        luma_b = jpg_intensities('/absolute/path/to/2544057.jpg')  # image can ge found in the tests folder.
        # if you don't know the file type, you can have it picked up with the `mimetype` module:
        luma_b = image_intensities('/absolute/path/to/2544057.jpg')  # image can ge found in the tests folder.
        
        # returns something like
        luma_a = Intensities(nw=35.832628091300684, ne=10.513891063388744, sw=20.76546499989676, se=20.831389937866714)
        luma_b = Intensities(nw=8.284639125603292, ne=8.466390155604937, sw=22.851929679674072, se=23.26008498727572)
        
        # You can compare them, exact match (which is probably not what you want, see .compare(…) below)
        luma_a == luma_b
        # -> False
        
        # or a distance comparison
        luma_a.compare(luma_b, distance=0.25)
        # -> False  # those two images are very different, after all
        ```
        
        A good distance is usually between `0.2` and `0.5`, the default is `0.25`.
        
        
        ### Pure Python
        There's also a pure python version, which thanks to PIL/Pillow supports about every image type:
        
        > ⚠️ Note: You need to install **Pillow** (`pip install Pillow`) for this to work, see [Dependencies](#dependencies) below.  
        > ⚠️ Note: For animated image types it will probably use the first frame.
        
        ```python
        from image_intensities.pure_python import png_intensities, jpg_intensities, image_intensities, Intensities
        
        luma = image_intensities('/path/to/image.gif')
        
        # returns something like
        luma == Intensities(nw=0.42, ne=0.44, sw=0.58, se=0.69)
        ```
        
        
        # Dependencies
        ### C-Extension
        #### MacOS
        ```bash
        brew install libpng
        ```
         (tested to work with 1.6.37)
        
        #### Ubuntu
        (There's also a version for [Dockerfiles](#dockerfile) available)
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
        ```
        
        <a name="dockerfile"></a>
        #### Dockerfile (Ubuntu based)
        ```bash
        apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y libpng-dev && apt-get clean && rm -rfv /var/lib/apt/lists/*
        ```
        > ⚠️ Make sure you pull a recent release of the python docker image (even if it's an older python version!).
        > Especially if you're getting errors complaining about a `png_set_longjmp_fn` function when you try to use it.
        > As time of writing the 2-month old version did not work, but the newest releases (`python:3.6`: `6ac87e65b6d0`, `pythong:3.9`: `1b33974176a3`) ones have that fixed.  
        
        ### Pure python algorithm _(optional)_
        This one is usually not needed, unless you wanna benefit from pillow's ability to read the strangest image formats.
        But probably it's faster to write it to disk as either `.jpg` or `.png` and use the native C versions as above.
        
        ```bash
        pip install Pillow
        ```
        
        # Installation
        See dependencies above, and make sure those are installed as needed. 
        
        ### Install via pip
        ```bash
        pip install image_intensities
        ```
        
        ##### Mac OS:
        ```bash
        CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include/' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib/' pip install image_intensities
        ```
        
        ### From source
        E.g. you checked out this repository:
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ##### Mac OS:
        ```bash
        CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include/' LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib/' python setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        ### Minimal installation example
        
        Using docker as it already has a working `libpng-dev`:
        
        ```sh
        docker pull python:3.9
        docker run -it --rm python:3.9 bash
        pip install image_intensities
        
        # test import
        python -c"import image_intensities as it; print(it._intensities.ffi)"
        
        # test with a png
        wget https://derpicdn.net/img/download/2015/8/9/954482.png -O /tmp/954482.png
        python -c"from image_intensities import png_intensities; print(png_intensities('/tmp/954482.png'))"
        
        # test with a jpg
        wget https://derpicdn.net/img/download/2021/2/4/2544057.jpg -O /tmp/2544057.jpg  # we need to use an absolute path!
        python -c"from image_intensities import jpeg_intensities; print(jpeg_intensities('/tmp/2544057.jpg'))"
        ```
