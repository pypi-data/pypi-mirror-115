 What's new in IOSACal
=======================

Release news for IOSACal.

Release 0.5.2 (2021-08-01)
==========================

A bugfix release.

- make the calibration curve data available in the distribution
  packages
- fixed problem with AD/BC plot missing the calibration curve
  (contributed by Karl Håkansson)

Version 0.5.1 was tagged without any changes from 0.5 described below.

Release 0.5 (2021-07-28)
========================

This release brings the new IntCal20 calibration data and several
improvements for different use cases, plus one important bug fix.

- the project has moved to **Codeberg** for source code hosting and issue
  tracking. The new Git repository is at
  https://codeberg.org/steko/iosacal with a default branch name of
  *main*
- there is an official **Code of Conduct** that all contributors
  (including the maintainter) will need to follow
- the documentation has seen some improvements, in particular in the
  *Contributing* section. Overall, making contributions easier from both
  expert and novice users is a major theme in this release.
- interactive use in Jupyter notebooks is made easier with
  CalibrationCurve that can be created in many ways (such as loading
  from an arbitrary file, or from a standard calibration curve called
  by shorthand)
- fixed a bug that made plots with AD/CE setting incorrect
  (contributed by Karl Håkansson)
- fixed a bug that caused a wrong plot density function for dates 80
  BP to 0 BP (contributed by Karl Håkansson)
- add IntCal20 calibration data (contributed by Wesley Weatherbee)

On the technical side:

- the command line interface is now based on the Click library
- most code is now covered by tests, based on pytest
- Python 3.6 or above required
- requires Numpy 1.18 and Matplotlib 3.0


Release 0.4 (released 2018-05-08)
=================================

The main highlight of this release are the new classes for summed probability
distributions (SPD) and paleodemography, contributed by Mario Gutiérrez-Roig
as part of his work for the PALEODEM_ project at IPHES_.

.. _IPHES: http://www.iphes.cat/

On the technical side:

- requires NumPy 1.14, SciPy 1.1 and Matplotlib 2.2
- removed dependencies on obsolete functions
- improved the command line interface

Release 0.3 (released 2016-04-15)
=================================

- use ``genfromtxt`` to import calibration curves
- improved documentation
- intervals as a well-defined type
- restore AD/BC dates in both text and graphic output

Release 0.2 (released 2014-02-14)
=================================

Main highlights:

- new function to combine multiple determinations (Ward & Wilson 1978)
- a simple and straightforward set of commands to get started
- amazing interactive mode with IPython Notebook
- plotting multiple dates in a stacked plot actually works
- added several older calibration curves (useful to check published data)

On the technical side:

- works with Python 3 only, dropped compatibility with Python 2
- requires NumPy 1.8 and Matplotlib 1.3
- calibration curves and calibrated ages are ``ndarray`` objects, super-easy
  to work with

Known issues:

- AD/BC dates in output are not available, all dates are given as CalBP
