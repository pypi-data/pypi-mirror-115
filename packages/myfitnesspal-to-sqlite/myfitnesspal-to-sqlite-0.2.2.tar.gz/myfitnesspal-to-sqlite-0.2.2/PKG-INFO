        Save data from MyFitnessPal to a SQLite database.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install this tool using `pip`:
        
            $ pip install myfitnesspal-to-sqlite
        
        ## Authentication
        
        This tool relies on `python-myfitnesspal`, which allows [authentication via the system keyring](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal#authentication).
        
        Install `python-myfitnesspal` using `pip`:
        
            $ pip install myfitnesspal
        
        Store your MyFitnessPal password in the system keyring:
        
            $ myfitnesspal store_password my_user
        
        Note that all commands assume that your password is stored in the system keyring.
        
        ## Fetching diary entries
        
        The `diary` command retrieves food, exercise, goal and measurement entries for a given user and date.
        
            $ myfitnesspal-to-sqlite diary myfitnesspal.db my_user 2021-07-14
        
        ## Development
        
        To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
        
            cd myfitnesspal-to-sqlite
            python -mvenv venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Or if you are using `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv shell
        
        Now install the dependencies and tests:
        
            pip install -e '.[test]'
        
        To run the tests:
        
            pytest
