class RandomRecommender(BaseRecommender):
    """
    A recommender system that randomly recommends items to each user.

    Item attributes are represented by a :math:`1\\times|I|` array, where
    :math:`|I|` is the number of items in the system. This array stores the
    number of user interactions for each item.

    User profiles are represented by a :math:`|U|\\times 1` matrix, where
    :math:`|U|` is the number of users in the system. All elements of this matrix
    are equal to 1, as the predictions of the system are solely based on the
    item attributes.

    Parameters
    -----------

        num_users: int, default 100
            The number of users :math:`|U|` in the system.

        num_items: int, default 1250
            The number of items :math:`|I|` in the system.

        actual_user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or \
                            :class:`~components.users.Users`, optional
            Either a :math:`|U|\\times|T|` matrix representing the real user
            profiles, where :math:`T` is the number of attributes in the real
            underlying user profile, or a `Users` object that contains the real
            user profiles or real user-item scores. This matrix is **not** used
            for recommendations. This is only kept for measurements and the
            system is unaware of it.

        actual_item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|T|\\times|I|` matrix representing the real user profiles, where
            :math:`T` is the number of attributes in the real underlying item profile.
            This matrix is **not** used for recommendations. This
            is only kept for measurements and the system is unaware of it.

        num_items_per_iter: int, default 10
            Number of items presented to the user per iteration.

        seed: int, optional
            Seed for random generator.

    Attributes
    -----------
        Inherited from BaseRecommender: :class:`~models.recommender.BaseRecommender`

    Examples
    ---------
        RandomRecommender can be instantiated with no arguments -- in which
        case, it will be initialized with the default parameters.

        >>> rr = RandomRecommender()
        >>> rr.users_hat.shape
        (100, 1)   # <-- 100 users (default)
        >>> rr.items.shape
        (1, 1250) # <-- 1250 items (default)

        This class can be customized by defining the number of users and/or items
        in the system.

        >>> rr = RandomRecommender(num_users=1200, num_items=5000)
        >>> rr.users_hat.shape
        (1200, 1) # <-- 1200 users
        >>> rr.items.shape
        (1, 5000)

        If the arguments `score_fn`, `user_representation`, or `item_representation`
        are passed in, they will be ignored, since the random recommender relies on
        these representations. Note that all arguments passed in at initialization
        must be consistent - otherwise, an error is thrown.
