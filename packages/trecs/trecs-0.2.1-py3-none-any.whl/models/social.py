class SocialFiltering(BaseRecommender, BinarySocialGraph):
    """
    A customizable social filtering recommendation system.

    With social filtering, users are presented items that were previously
    liked by other users in their social networks.

    The social network is represented by a :math:`|U|\\times|U|` matrix, where
    :math:`|U|` is the number of users in the system. For each pair of users
    :math:`u` and :math:`v`, entry `[u,v]` defines whether :math:`u`
    "follows"/is connected to :math:`v`. This can be a binary relationship or a
    score that measures how likely :math:`u` is to engage with content that
    :math:`v` has previously interacted with.

    Please note that, in this class, the follow/unfollow and
    add_friends/remove_friends methods assume a binary social graph
    (see :class:`~components.socialgraph.BinarySocialGraph`).

    Item attributes are represented by a :math:`|U|\\times|I|` matrix, where
    :math:`|I|` is the number of items in the system. For each item :math:`i`
    and user :math:`u`, we define a score that determines the interactions
    :math:`u` had with :math:`i`. Again, this could just be a binary
    relationship.


    Parameters
    -----------

        num_users: int, default 100
            The number of users :math:`|U|` in the system.

        num_items: int, default 1250
            The number of items :math:`|I|` in the system.

        user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|U|\\times|U|` adjacency matrix representing each users'
            social network. If this is not None, `num_users` is ignored.

        item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|U|\\times|I|` matrix representing the past user interactions.
            If this is not None, `num_items` is ignored.

        actual_user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or \
                            :class:`~components.users.Users`, optional
            Either a :math:`|U|\\times|T|` matrix representing the real user
            profiles, where :math:`T` is the number of attributes in the real
            underlying user profile, or a `Users` object that contains the real
            user profiles or real user-item scores. This matrix is **not** used
            for recommendations. This is only kept for measurements and the
            system is unaware of it.

        actual_item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|T|\\times|I|` matrix representing the real item profiles,
            where :math:`T` is the number of attributes in the real underlying
            item profile. This matrix is **not** used for recommendations. This
            is only kept for measurements and the system is unaware of it.

        num_items_per_iter: int, default 10
            Number of items presented to the user per iteration.

        seed: int, optional
            Seed for random generator.

    Attributes
    -----------
        Inherited from BaseRecommender : :class:`~models.recommender.BaseRecommender`

    Examples
    ----------
        SocialFiltering can be instantiated with no arguments -- in which case,
        it will be initialized with the default parameters and the item/user
        representation will be initialized to zero. This means that a user
        starts with no followers/users they follow, and that there have been no
        previous interactions for this set of users.

        >>> sf = SocialFiltering()
        >>> sf.users_hat.shape
        (100, 100)   # <-- 100 users (default)
        >>> sf.items.shape
        (100, 1250) # <-- 100 users (default), 1250 items (default)

        This class can be customized either by defining the number of users
        and/or items in the system:

        >>> sf = SocialFiltering(num_users=1200, num_items=5000)
        >>> sf.items.shape
        (1200, 5000) # <-- 1200 users, 5000 items

        >>> sf = ContentFiltering(num_users=50)
        >>> sf.items.shape
        (50, 1250) # <-- 50 users, 1250 items (default)

        Or by generating representations for items and/or users. In the example
        below, items are uniformly distributed. We "indirectly" define 100 users
        by defining a `100x200` item representation.

        >>> item_representation = np.random.randint(2, size=(100, 200))
        # Social networks are drawn from a binomial distribution.
        # This representation also uses 100 users.
        >>> sf = SocialFiltering(item_representation=item_representation)
        >>> sf.items.shape
        (100, 200)
        >>> sf.users_hat.shape
        (100, 100)

        Note that all arguments passed in at initialization must be consistent -
        otherwise, an error is thrown. For example, one cannot pass in
        ``num_users=200`` but have ``user_representation.shape`` be ``(200, 500)`` or
        ``(300, 300)``. Likewise, one cannot pass in ``num_items=1000`` but have
        ``item_representation.shape`` be ``(200, 500)``.
