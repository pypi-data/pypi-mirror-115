class ImplicitMF(BaseRecommender):
    """
    A customizable implicit matrix factorization recommendation system.

    In the implicit matrix factorization model, there is first a training
    period in which users choices are recorded by the recommender system
    in a user-item interaction matrix, where each cell of the matrix represents
    the number of times the given user (row) has interacted with a particular item
    (column). After training data is collected, the MF model performs a "fitting"
    operation to produce latent feature vectors for both the users and the
    items. These latent feature vectors are used as the basis for future
    recommendations. The MF model may be "refit".

    Item attributes are represented by a :math:`k\\times|I|` array, where
    :math:`|I|` is the number of items in the system and :math:`k` is the
    number of features in the latent representation.

    User profiles are represented by a :math:`|U|\\times k` matrix, where
    :math:`|U|` is the number of users in the system.

    See the underlying implementation used from `lkpy`_.

    .. _`lkpy`: https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy

    Parameters
    -----------

        num_users: int, default 100
            The number of users :math:`|U|` in the system.

        num_items: int, default 1250
            The number of items :math:`|I|` in the system.

        num_latent_factors: int, default 10
            The number of latent factors that will be used to fit the Implicit MF
            model.

        item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|A|\\times|I|` matrix representing the latent representations
            of the items. If this is not None, `num_items` is ignored.

        user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|U|\\times|A|` matrix representing the latent reprsentations
            of the users. If this is not None, `num_users` is ignored.

        actual_user_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray` or \
                            :class:`~components.users.Users`, optional
            Either a :math:`|U|\\times|T|` matrix representing the real user
            profiles, where :math:`T` is the number of attributes in the real
            underlying user profile, or a `Users` object that contains the real
            user profiles or real user-item scores. This matrix is **not** used
            for recommendations. This is only kept for measurements and the
            system is unaware of it.

        actual_item_representation: :obj:`numpy.ndarray`, optional
            A :math:`|T|\\times|I|` matrix representing the real user profiles, where
            :math:`T` is the number of attributes in the real underlying item profile.
            This matrix is **not** used for recommendations. This
            is only kept for measurements and the system is unaware of it.

        num_items_per_iter: int, default 10
            Number of items presented to the user per iteration.

        model_params: dict, optional
            Arguments that can be passed to `lenskit.algorithms.als.ImplicitMF()` that
            dictate model training. For example: `{'iterations':40, 'reg':0.01}`.

        seed: int, optional
            Seed for random generator.

    Attributes
    -----------
        Inherited from BaseRecommender: :class:`~models.recommender.BaseRecommender`

    Examples
    ---------
        ImplicitMF can be instantiated with no arguments -- in which case,
        it will be initialized with the default parameters and the item/user
        representations will be assigned randomly.

        >>> mf = ImplicitMF()
        >>> mf.users_hat.shape
        (100, 10)   # <-- 100 users (default), 10 latent features (default)
        >>> mf.items.shape
        (10, 1250) # <-- 10 latent features (default), 1250 items (default)

        This class can be customized either by defining the number of users/items/latent
        features in the system.

        >>> mf = ImplicitMF(num_users=1200, num_items=5000)
        >>> mf.users_hat.shape
        (1200, 10) # <-- 1200 users, 10 attributes

        >>> mf = ImplicitMF(num_users=1200, num_items=5000, num_latent_features=2000)
        >>> mf.users_hat.shape
        (1200, 2000) # <-- 1200 users, 2000 attributes

        Note that all arguments passed in at initialization must be consistent -
        otherwise, an error is thrown. For example, one cannot pass in
        `num_users=200` but have `user_representation.shape` be `(300, 100)`.
        Likewise, one cannot pass in `num_items=1000` but have
        `item_representation.shape` be `(100, 500)`.

        To use the model, it's advised to use the `startup_and_train` method, which
        will collect user interaction data from random recommendations. At the end
        of the startup period, an implicit matrix factorization model is fit to the
        interaction data, generating new user/item latent representations. These
        representations are fixed and used for future calls to `run`.

        >>> mf = ImplicitMF(num_latent_features=10) # 10 latent features
        >>> mf.startup_and_train(50) # 50 timesteps of training
        >>> mf.run(100)

        If you'd like to retrain the matrix factorization model at any point, you
        may use the `train` method. It will fit a new set of latent user/item
        representations based on the interaction data from the *most recent* call to
        `run()`.

        >>> mf.run(50)
        >>> mf.run(50) # on new call to `run`, interaction data from previous `run` is discarded
        >>> mf.train() # MF model fit to data from most recent call to `run`
