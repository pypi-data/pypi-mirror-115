# Prython

Inspired by [Ruby's pry gem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pry/pry) and [this snippet](https://gist.github.com/obfusk/208597ccc64bf9b436ed).

This module is a runtime debugger, made to be very lightweight, very easy to use and completely interoperable amongst both Python 2 & 3. If you want to take a look at Python's official debugger, [this is it](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).

## Installation

Install from PyPi with:

```bash
pip install prython
```
