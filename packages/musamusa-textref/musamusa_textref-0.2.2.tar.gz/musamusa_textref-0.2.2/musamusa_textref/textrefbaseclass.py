   MusaMusa-TextRef project : musamusa_textref/textrefbaseclass.py

   The TextRefBaseClass helps to compare textual references.

   Don't directly use this class : use instead derived classes like TextRefDefault.

   Beware ! TextRef* classes don't store the source string you may used to initialize
            such an object. You have to store this source string apart.


   Unit testing: see tests/textrefbaseclass.py



   (pimydoc)about textual references
   ⋅ References to a text are a way to locate an excerpt in a longer text.
   ⋅
   ⋅ For the user, a textual reference (=textref) is a string describing one
   ⋅ or more references:
   ⋅
   ⋅         By example. "title.43a-title.44b" means
   ⋅                     title.43a+title.43b+title.44a+title.44b
   ⋅
   ⋅ Under the hood, three levels of references are distinguished:
   ⋅
   ⋅     - mono-textref like "title.43a"
   ⋅         > "title.43a" means nothing but "title.43a"
   ⋅     - bi-textref like "title.43a" or "title.43a-title.44b"
   ⋅         > "title.43a-title.44b" means
   ⋅           title.43a+title.43b+title.44a+title.44b
   ⋅     - multi-textref like "title.43a-", "title.43a-title.44b"
   ⋅       or "title.43a-title.44b;title.43c"
   ⋅         > "title.43a-title.44b;title.43c" means
   ⋅           title.43a+title.43b+title.44a+title.44b+title.43c

   (pimydoc)monoref/biref/multiref(internal)
   ⋅ Internal representation of mono-/bi-/multi- textref:
   ⋅
   ⋅     o  mono textref: "title.3" is internally stored as:
   ⋅
   ⋅                     ((None, 'title'), ('int', 3))
   ⋅                       ^     ^             ^     ^
   ⋅                       ^     ^             ^     value (here, a int)
   ⋅                       ^     ^             ^
   ⋅                       ^     ^             [0] : value type
   ⋅                       ^     ^
   ⋅                       ^     [1]value : since [0] is None, it's a string.
   ⋅                       ^
   ⋅                       [0] is None if the value (here 'title') is not countable
   ⋅
   ⋅     o  bi textref: "title.3-title.4" is internally stored as:
   ⋅
   ⋅                     (
   ⋅                      ((None, 'title'), ('int', 3)),
   ⋅                      ((None, 'title'), ('int', 4))
   ⋅                     )
   ⋅
   ⋅                     "title.3-" is internally stored as:
   ⋅
   ⋅                     (
   ⋅                      ((None, 'title'), ('int', 3)),
