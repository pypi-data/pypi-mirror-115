Description: # pDMN
        
        ## Welcome to the pDMN solver's code repository.
        
        pDMN stands for Probabilistic Decision and Model Notation.
        It is an extension to the [DMN](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/About-DMN/) standard, which aims to add probabilistic reasoning while maintaining DMN's goal of being readable and user-friendly.
