Description: ## Typing stubs for Jinja2
        
        This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Jinja2` package.
        It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
        that uses `Jinja2`. The source for this package can be found at
        https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/Jinja2. All fixes for
        types and metadata should be contributed there.
        
        *Note:* The `Jinja2` package includes type annotations or type stubs
        since version 3.0. Please uninstall the `types-Jinja2`
        package if you use this or a newer version.
