Sandbox repo for myself: write the best possible Minesweeper code!

## Context
I am doing this side-project as a hobby. It is relatively easy to write a working minesweeper but it's harder to code nicely. My intention here is to write and enhance my code as I learn new coding guidelines. I am currently learning from the following sources:
- book "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin (2002)
- book "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas (2019 Remaster)
- YouTuber ArjanCodes
