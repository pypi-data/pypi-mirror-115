# Overview

Eze the one stop solution for security testing in modern development

Features:
- improve uptake of security testing in modern development
- improve discovery and uptake of open source security tools
- provide single cli entrypoint to run the multiple tools needed to test modern applications
- simple multi-tool configuration via a single common configuration file
- quick setup via Dockerfile with preinstalled tools
- normalise multiple tool output into common report format
- extending capabilities of opensource tools
  (adding missing features like ignore patterns, version detection, and cve metadata annotation, as needed)
- extendable plugin architecture for adding new security tools to eze
- layering enterprise level reporting and auditing via the eze management console (PAID service offered by RiverSafe)

This tool can be run locally on the cli by developers or security consultants, or deeply integrated into a team / organisations CI pipeline, with team and organisation management dashboards available for reviewing and monitoring the overall security of a organisation's estate.

# Installation
## Use Locally via Pip
Install eze with pip. Keep in mind that eze only supports Python 3.7 and up.

```bash
pip install eze-cli
```

## Use in Container via Docker
Eze can also be used inside a Docker image, the default Dockerfile contains the eze cli and a selection of common opensource tools out the box.

It's recommended to tailor this Dockerfile, download it and add/remove tools as needed to optimise size of the image.

```bash
# Pull docker image
docker pull riversafe/eze-cli:latest

# Test docker running ok
docker run riversafe/eze-cli --version

# Run pulled image in docker (cmd)
docker run --rm -v %cd%:/data riversafe/eze-cli test

# Run pulled image in (powershell)
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/data riversafe/eze-cli test

# Run pulled image in (git bash)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd -W):/data riversafe/eze-cli test

# Run pulled image in (linux/mac os bash)
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data riversafe/eze-cli test
```

# Usage

## Test install

```bash
eze --version
```
