# Litecoder

> US city + state geocoding, without a heavy webservice. With [Who's On First](https://www.whosonfirst.org/) and SQLite.

Sometimes you've got "location" fields that contain a weird mix of cities and states. Stuff like:

- `SF`
- `Los Angeles, CA`
- `Boston`
- `California`
- `bellingham washington`
- `NYC`
- `tuscaloosa AL`
- `big apple`

To make use of these, they generally need to be linked against some kind of canonical set of geographic entities. One approach is to throw them at a commercial geocoder like [Google](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/geocoding/), but this is slow and expensive, and there are often [onerous terms-of-service restrictions](https://www.mapbox.com/tos/#[YmouYmoq]) on the results. And, really, a full-blown geocoder is overkill here, since these kinds of location fields almost never contain street addresses, just references to a smaller set of high-level locations.

Litecoder is a small library that links these kinds of free-text location strings to records in the [Who's On First](https://www.whosonfirst.org/) (WOF) gazetteer from Mapzen, which includes both high-quality geographic metadata as well as IDs for corresponding records in a number of other gazetteers and knowledge databases (Wikipedia, Wikidata, DBpedia, Geonames, etc). Mapzen sadly doesn't exist anymore, but the WOF data is [CC-0](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

For now, Litecoder only supports US cities and states.

## Now
- Be fast. Lookups take ~20Âµs.
- Work anywhere without hassle. The underlying data ships with the package and is small enough to fit in memory (~100m). Since everything sits in RAM, the library can be used in ETL and big data workflows involving billions of inputs.
- Comprehensive support for [nicknames and abbreviations](litecoder/data/city-alt-names.yml). Eg, `Windy City` always means Chicago.
- Some heuristics are unavoidable - eg, `Boston` should map to `Boston, MA`, not `Boston, GA` (which exists!). In these cases, do something simple and easy to reason about.

## Future
- Match locations embedded inside of surrounding text. For now, the assumption is that you've got a snippet of text that represents a location, and the goal is to figure out which one.
- Locations more granular than cities / towns - major parks, venues, etc.
- International cities + countries.

## Installation

If you would like to install the development version, please run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/social-machines/litecoder.git
cd litecoder
pipenv install
```

Otherwise, you can download `litecoder` using `pip`

```
pip install litecoder
```

## Examples

### US cities

```python
from litecoder.usa import USCityIndex

# Load the pre-built index.
idx = USCityIndex()
idx.load()

# Basic city, state, country.
idx['Boston, Massachusetts']
idx['Boston, MA']
idx['Boston, MA, USA']
>> [CityMatch<Boston, Massachusetts, United States, wof:85950361>]

# Normalize differences in capitalization, spacing, commas.
idx['boston, ma']
idx['boston ma']
idx['   boston   ma   ']
idx['BOSTON MA']
>> [CityMatch<Boston, Massachusetts, United States, wof:85950361>]

# For major cities, match the "bare" city name.
idx['Boston']
>> [CityMatch<Boston, Massachusetts, United States, wof:85950361>]

# Since "Boston" alone (almost) never refers to Boston, GA!
idx['Boston, GA']
>> [CityMatch<Boston, Georgia, United States, wof:85936819>]

# But don't guess when there isn't a clear "major" city...
idx['Springfield']
>> []

# ... Until more detail is provided.
idx['Springfield, IL']
>> [CityMatch<Springfield, Illinois, United States, wof:85940429>]

# Match major abbreviations, alternate names, nicknames.
idx['NYC']
idx['New York City']
idx['Big Apple']
idx['Nueva York']
>> [CityMatch<New York, New York, United States, wof:85977539>]
```

### US states

```python
from litecoder.usa import USStateIndex

# Load the pre-built index.
idx = USStateIndex()
idx.load()

# Basic state, country.
idx['Massachusetts']
idx['Massachusetts, USA']
>> [StateMatch<Massachusetts, United States, wof:85688645>]
```

## mmap

Litecoder supports a memory mapped index load:

```python
from litecoder.usa import USCityIndex

idx = USCityIndex()
idx.load(mmap=True)
```

When enabled, the index will share memory with any other index in any
other process on the machine also loaded with `mmap=True`. This is
useful in parallel processing contexts where you may want a litecoder
instances per process, but the sum total of the memory usage would
exceed the machine resources. In addition to the memory efficiency,
memory mapping a file is faster than `mmap=False`, which is the
default and copies the entire database into memory. The trade-off is
that initial accesses to the database with `mmap=True` may be slower
as the operating system lazily pages data in as needed.


## Metadata

The city and state indexes return "match" objects that hold all metadata associated with the location, as well as denormalized copies of parent entities.

### US cities

```python
idx = USCityIndex()
idx.load()

sf = idx['San Francisco'][0]

sf['name']
>> 'San Francisco'

sf['population']

sf['latitude']
>> 37.759715

sf['longitude']
>> -122.693976

sf['region'].['name_abbr']
>> 'CA'
