Note:

* If we want to add another plugin to this, add the plugin details in the config file under the plugins section and create your new input file in the input folder.
* The input python file name should always be same as the plugin name. In this case plugin name is "etl".
* There should be a fuction named "work" with config parameter which will be invoked when we run the script.
* The work fuction should return list of dictionary objects.

# Installation
