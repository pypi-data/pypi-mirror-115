List is ordered from predicted best to worst timestamps.\n* All algorithms can save the returned list as a .json if `save_json=True` is passed in.\n\n# Background\nPillar is creating an innovative way to automatically select and splice clips from Twitch videos for streamers. This repo is focusing on the algorithm aspect. Three main algorithms are being tested.\n\n## Algorithms\n\n1. [Algorithm 1](https://github.com/pomkos/twitch_chat_analysis/blob/reorganize_repo/algorithm_1.ipynb): Find the best moments in clips based on where the most users participated. Most is defined as the *ratio of unique users* during a 2 min section to unique users for the entire session.\n1. [Algorithm 2](https://github.com/pomkos/twitch_chat_analysis/blob/reorganize_repo/algorithm_2.ipynb) Find the best moments in clips based on when rate of messages per user peaked. This involves answering the question "at which 2 min segment do the most users send the most messages?". If users X, Y, and Z all send 60% of their messages at timestamp range delta, then that timestamp might qualify as a "best moment"\n   1. __NOTE__: Currently answers the question "at which 2 min segment do users send the most messages fastest"\n1. [Algorithm 3 (WIP)](https://github.com/pomkos/twitch_chat_analysis/blob/reorganize_repo/algorithm_3.ipynb) Weigh each user by their chat rate, account age, etc. Heavier users predicted to chat more often at "best moment" timestamps \n   1. __STATUS__: current weight determined by (`num_words_of_user`/`num_words_of_top_user`)\n   1. [Algorithm 3.5](https://github.com/pomkos/twitch_chat_analysis/blob/reorganize_repo/algorithm_3.5.ipynb) Finds the best moments in clips based on most number of words/emojis/both used in chat\n\n### Timeit results\nResults as of `April 13, 2021 18:31 EST` run on `big_df` with 80841 rows, 10 columns.\n\n| algo1  | algo2        | algo3_0 | algo3_5 |\n|--------|--------------|---------|---------|\n|2.2 sec | 1 min 23 sec |28.1 sec | 16.3 sec|\n\n# Build\nTo build and publish this package we are using the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) python packager. It takes care of some background stuff that led to [mistakes in the past](https://github.com/pillargg/twitch_chat_analysis/issues/8).\n\nFolder structure:\n```\n|-- dev_tools\n    |-- pillaralgos_dev\n        |-- __init__.py\n        |-- dev_helpers.py # aws connection, file retrieval script\n        |-- sanity_checks.py # placeholder\n    |-- README.md \n    |-- pyproject.toml\n|-- prod\n    |-- pillaralgos  # <---- note that poetry didn\'t require an additional subfolder\n        |-- helpers\n            |-- __init__.py\n            |-- data_handler.py\n            |-- emoji_getter.py\n        |-- __init__.py  # must include version number\n        |-- algoXX.py  # all algorithms in separate files\n        |-- brain.py\n    |-- LICENSE\n    |-- README.md\n    |-- pyproject.toml  # must include version number\n    |-- reinstall_pill.sh # quick script to uninstall local pillaralgos, build and install new one\n```\nTo publish just run the `poetry publish --build` command after update version numbers as needed.\n\n# Changelog\n\n* New algorithms\n* Algo3.6: rank timestamps by emoji:user ratio\n* Algo4: rank timestamps by compound score from SentimentAnalyzer\n* Unit testing for algo 3.6',
