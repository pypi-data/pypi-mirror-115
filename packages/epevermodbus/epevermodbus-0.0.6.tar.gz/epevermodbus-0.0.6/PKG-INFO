Description: # epevermodbus
        
        This package is intended to help you communicate with an EPever charge controller. It has been tested with an EPever Tracer AN but should work with other devices.
        
        ## Connecting to the charge controller
        
        You have two options
        
        * Official EPever cable
        * Your own custom cable
        
        ## Installing the package
        
        To install the package run
        
        ```sh
        pip install epevermodbus
        ```
        
        ## Command line utility
        
        To run the command line utility and see the debug output run the following on the command line
        
        ```sh
        epevermodbus
        ```
        
        Example output
        
        ```sh

        ## Python usage
        
        To use the library within your Python code
        
        ```python
        from epevermodbus.driver import EpeverChargeController
        
        
        controller = EpeverChargeController("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)
        
        controller.get_solar_voltage()
        ```
