        This tool provides a library, along with a command line interface, fully packaged binaries, and
        PyPi distributed wheels, for doing conversion of EnergyPlus EpJSON files.  While EpJSON files may not change
        significantly between versions, there are still changes required sometimes.  At a minimum the version number.

        [![PEP8 Enforcement](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Myoldmopar/EpJSONTransition/Flake8?label=Flake8&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Myoldmopar/EpJSONTransition/actions?query=workflow%3AFlake8)
        
        The project is tested using standard Python unit testing practices.
        Each commit is automatically tested with Github Actions on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04.
        The code coverage across platforms is collected on Coveralls.
        When a tag is created in the GitHub Repo, Github Actions builds downloadable packages.
        
        To run the unit test suite, make sure to have nose and coverage installed via: `pip install nose coverage`.
        Then execute `coverage run setup.py nosetests`.
        Unit test results will appear in the console, and coverage results will be in a `htmlcov` directory.
