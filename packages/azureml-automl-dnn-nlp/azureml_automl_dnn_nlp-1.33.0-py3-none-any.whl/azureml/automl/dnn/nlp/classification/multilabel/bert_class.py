#
# You can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction,
# but it's mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task.
# See the model hub to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.
#
# Note that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole
# sentence (potentially masked) to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token
# classification or question answering. For tasks such as text generation you should look
# at model like GPT2.
