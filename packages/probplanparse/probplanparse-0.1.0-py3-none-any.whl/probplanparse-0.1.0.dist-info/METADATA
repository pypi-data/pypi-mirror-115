A small library that parses through the report.txt file and converts to a `user-dict` made up of Hypothesis objects. This will use report.txt files from the `external-project`.

Use `pip install probplanparse` to install package.

Here is a short example of how to use this package:

```python
import probplanparse

probplanparse.parse_report('/mnt/c/Users/14022/Documents/SIFT/external-planner/pr_result/report.txt')
```
