A small library that parses through the report.txt file and converts to a `user-dict` made up of Hypothesis objects. This will use report.txt files from the `external-project`.

Use `pip install probplanparse` to install package.

Here is a short example of how to use this package:

```python
import probplanparse

probplanparse.parse_report('/mnt/c/Users/14022/Documents/SIFT/external-planner/pr_result/report.txt')
```

If you have a folder full of `.tar.bz2` result folders, you can use the following script:

```python
import probplanparse
import os
import sys

for (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) in os.walk('./prob-plan-results/'):
    for filename in filenames:
        if filename.endswith('.tar.bz2'):
            try:
                probplanparse.parse_report(os.path.join('prob-plan-results', filename), True)
            except:
                print("Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info())
                pass
```
