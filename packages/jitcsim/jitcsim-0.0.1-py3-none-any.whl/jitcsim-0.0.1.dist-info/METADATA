# JITCSIM

Just-in time compilation differential equations for simulation of complex network dynamics.

It mainly use [JITC*DE](https://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode) packages for solving differential equations.

### installation

```sh
cd JITCSIM # directory where you have setup.py
pip3 install -e .
```
