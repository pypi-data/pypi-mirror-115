Description: # Retirable resources
        
        A Python library for using Google Cloud Firestore to manage resources have a lifecycle: creation -> use -> retirement.
        
        During "use", each resource can be used for different purposes by a set
        of "owners". Each owner can retire their use of the resource independently
        of other owners. When all owners have retired a resource, it is automatically
        retired.
        
        ## Testing
        
        Run the emulator with `firebase emulators:start --project foo`
        
        Then run the tests with `python -m unittest`
        
        ## TODO
        
        Script up running the emmulator, and passing its port to the test script
        
        `emulators:exec *scriptpath*`
