# PreferredWavePlayer
This is my preferential player when I need to play just .wav files in a project.

It is multi-platform and has no dependencies, other than what comes with Windows 10, the standard Linux kernel, MacOS 10.5 or later, and the Python Standard Library.

It contains enough functions to be useful, but not too many to be confusing, and I tried to keep the syntax and implementation
super-simple and human readable.

When I built this module, I considered many factors that were important to me, 
like maintenance of code, ease of use, reliability and so forth.  I used these methods below as they seem to be the best 
choices, considering the above factors.

In a nutshell:

#### -Windows 10 uses the Windows winmm.dll Multimedia API to play sounds.
#### -Linux uses ALSA which is part of the Linux kernel since version 2.6 and later
#### -MacOS uses the afplay module which is present OS X 10.5 and later

To use the module simply add:
```
from preferredwaveplayer import *
```
and this will import all its functions.

The module essentially contains 3 functions for playing .wav files:
```
yourSound=playwave("yourfilename.wav") #or just playwave("yourfilename.wav")

stopwave(yourSound)

getIsPlaying(yourSound)
```
And a few more for looping .wav files:

```
backgroundSong = loopwave("yourfilename.wav")

and

stoploop(backgroundSong)
```

Here are some examples on how to use them.
Note that with 'playwave' it can be used as a standalone function, but if you want to stop the file from playing,
you will have to use the return value of playwave.  Read a little further and the examples hopefully will make sense.

### Examples:

#### To play a wave file:
```
playwave("coolhipstersong.wav") #-> this plays the wav file

mysong=playwave("coolhipstersong.wav") #-> this plays the wav file and also returns a reference to the song.
```

#### To stop your song:
```
stopwave(mysong) # -> this stops mysong, which you created in the line above
```

#### To find out if your wave file is playing:

```
isitplaying = getIsPlaying(mysong) -> sets a variable to True or False, depending on if process is running

print(getIsPlaying(mysong)) -> prints True or False depending on if process is running

if getIsPlaying(mysong)==True:
    print("Yes, your song is playing")
else:
    print("Your song is not playing")
```

#### To play a wave file synchronously:
```
playwave("coolhipsong.wav",1) #-> this plays the wav file synchronously

or

playwave("coolhipsong.wav",block=True)


* Note: commands below will work, but you cannot stop the song, because your progam will be blocked until the song is done playing

mysong=playwave("coolhipstersong.wav",1) #-> this plays the wav file synchronously and also returns the song reference

or 

mysong=playwave("coolhipstersong.wav",block=True) #-> this plays the wav file synchronously and also returns the song reference


```
#### To play a wave file in a continuous loop:

```
myloop=loopwave("mybackgroundsong.wav")

```
This starts a background loop playing, but also returns a reference to the background process so it can be stopped.
#### To stop the continuous loop from playing:

```
stoploop(myloop)

```

### Discussion - A little more about why I picked these methods:

### Windows 10
Windows10 functions use the winmm.dll Windows Multimedia API calls using c function calls to play sounds.

#### Playing Sounds in Windows:
This method of playing sounds allows for multiple simultaneous sounds, works well and has been used successfully in several projects.  As long as this dynamically linked library is bundled with the current version of Windows, I plan to use this as the preferred method of playing sounds unless there is a compelling reason to change.  In this case, I am using the reasoning "If it's not broke, don't fix it.".  Another advantage is it plays mp3s and other formats as well, not just .wav files.  It works well, is stable, loads and executes quickly, and has essentially never caused me any problems.

The Python `winsound` module on the other hand, is at least to me a bit odd in its syntax, less intuitive, and only uses wave files.  You basically can't play more than one wave at a time asynchronously.  This is severely limiting, so I don't prefer it for playing sounds.

Calling the winsound.PlaySound module through the OS system works, but not does not execute as quickly.  This may not be a bad approach, however, for background sounds whose fine-timing is not critical.

#### Looping Sounds in Windows:

In this latest version, I use the winmm.dll mciSendString calls with additional specifications to loop, rather than using with winsound module, as it allows for multiple simultaneous loops if you would need but more importantly will allow looping of mp3 files, in addition to .wav files.

##### Using OS System calls in Windows to loop sounds.

You can loop sounds by using OS system calls in the style of using command line instructions.

See https://pypi.org/project/oswaveplayer/ for an example.

This is not a bad approach, but there is a little delay with the sound launch using the command line version.  This may not be a big issue for you when playing background music.  Another way to play multiple background sounds at once would be to use another module or to add the oswaveplayer to your project with the import statement:

```
from oswaveplayer import oswaveplayer        #(this can be installed with "pip install oswaveplayer")
```
then use:
```
backgroundSong = oswaveplayer.loopwave("yourfilename.wav")
```
and
```
oswaveplayer.stoploop(backgroundSong)
```
This is not a bad approach, but due to the perceptible delay in playing the sound, it is not preferred to me.  You can also look over the source code to see how to launch sounds using this approach, as it is very basic.

### Linux and MacOS

`aplay` and `afplay` system calls work great on Linux and 'MacOS'.  I see no reason to invoke different methods at this point in time.  I do not want to concern myself with trying to make this module work with significantly older versions of MacOS before `afplay` was available.  My perception is that people typically would rather use Linux on an old computer systems instead of loading old versions of MacOS.  `afplay` has been present for some time now on MacOS.  Please contact me if you think this really needs to work on older versions of MacOS.  Additionally, Linux has been using ALSA in its main kernel for close to 20 years now, so using ALSA satisfies me.  There are other approaches possible, but their use seems less intuitive, harder to maintain, and overall unjustified.

#### You may not need a looping function to loop sounds:
##### A note on looping sounds in general:
If you using a game loop in game building, you don't actually need to use these looping functions at all (although it may be a little more convenient).  You may notice that this module, and other packages I have written, all contain a function called getIsPlaying(yoursound).  You can simply implement a check in your game loop to see if yoursong is playing.  If it is, don't do anything.  If it is not, play the sound with `yoursound=playwave("yourfilename.wav")`.  Maybe check every 10 frames or something like that in the game loop.

### Notes about using this module as a replacement in the playsound module:

Additionally, I included an alias/reference to the function named 'playsound', and if used, the default block will be true, or synchronous play.  This way, the
module can be used in place of the playsound module (https://github.com/TaylorSMarks/playsound/blob/master/playsound.py) with the same syntax.  If the playsound module is no longer maintained or otherwise does not work for you, you can load this module and use the import statement below for .wav files only.

Use:
```
from preferredwaveplayer import playsound
```
for backwards compatibility with the playsound module - .wav files only.

### Update 8/2/2021 -Manual 'Garbage Collection' now being performed in Windows when the winmm.dll module is used.
I added garbage collection which I believe sorely needed for this module.  Other players which I have cited have used the windows multimedia module to play sounds by issuing c type commands from python to the winmm.dll module.  The problem is that memory is allocated for these sounds using the c language.  The wimm.dll module sounds are supposed to be closed in order to reallocate that memory.  In windows this can be done by using and event listenter to report when the playing of the sound is complete, and then it can be closed.

It turns out is easy to issue a play command from python using the c commands wrapper.  However, it is much harder to set up an event listener and report it back to Python.  If it can be done at all it would be hard very complicated to do.

So I created my own garbage collection algorithm from the Python side of things.  Basically, every time a call to the winmm.dll module is called, that alias is added to a list.  Also, all prior aliases in the list are checked to see if the sound is playing.  If it is not, stop and close calls are issued to that sound alias, then the alias is removed from the garbage collection list.

In short before playing a new sound, prior sounds are checked to see if they have finished and then closed.  There is no event listended for, but cleanup is done at every play of a sound.
