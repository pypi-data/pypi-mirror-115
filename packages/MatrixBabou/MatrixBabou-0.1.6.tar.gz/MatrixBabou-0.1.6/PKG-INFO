# MatrixBabou
  
This library is for matrix analysis . Its created to facilitate some of notable tools in linear algebra like the matrix decompositions, solving linear systems, Tensors with  the classical products (Kronecker, Khatri-Rao, Hadamard..) , and all this functions are accelerated via the parallel computing methods as well as  quantum computing. 

## Installation
``` python3 -m pip install --user  MatrixBabou```



## How to use it?
It's used for Linear Algebra , matrix decompsition : NMF Decompsition <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cmathbf%7BA%5Capprox%20UV%7D%20"> ,
 and also for solving  matrix least square problem  : <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cmathbf%7B%5C%7CAX-B%5C%7C_2%5E2%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%5C%7CAx_i-%20b_i%5C%7C_2%20%5E2%7D"> Also, it can be used for to solve Ax=b , in quantum computer by importing quantum module.
