Description: # Walkway - motion detector
        
        Capture high-framerate videos of a custom-made, CatWalk-like setup for mice using FLIR's BlackFly cameras.
        A video is saved to disk every time motion is detected.
        
        ## Installation
        * Install [SpinView][SpinView]
        * Install [Python version 3.8][Python38]

        * Run `pip install sidewalk` or `python -m pip install sidewalk`.
        
        ## Usage overview
        * Power on IR ligth source.
        * Plug in camera to computer.
        * Setup camera using SpinView, if necessary:
        	- Start acquisition.
        	- Adjust camera aperture and focus to view region of interest under the light conditions expected during the experiment.
        	- Adjust image format to limit the view to the apparatus' sidewalk.
        	- Stop acquisition.
        * Open `cmd`
        * Run `python -m sidewalk`
        * Press `q` on the GUI or `ctrl+c` on the command window when done.
