# Releases

## peodd 0.2.2 - (2021-08-03)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Skip export of git url dependency\
   The exporting of git url dependency is not supported yet. This is
   causing TypeError Exception. This change adds a condition to skip it,
   avoiding the exception.


## peodd 0.2.1 - (2021-07-19)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix bug related to version conditions\
   The version conditions had a bug which caused errors converting the
   `bar = ">=1.2.2"` type of dependency. This fixes the bug by using the
   version instead of v key.


## peodd 0.2.0 - (2021-07-11)

**Performance improvements:**

 * Use tomli instead of tomlkit\
   tomli is 14x as fast as tomlkit. This change replaces existing tomlkit
   code with the tomli methods. It also adds a condition to validate the
   pyproject.toml file.


## peodd 0.1.0 - (2021-07-07)

**New features:**

 * Add script for exporting poetry dev-dependencies to a txt file\
   Poetry has an option to export the dependencies to a txt file. If you
   need the dev dependencies too, then you need add `dev` flag with the
   export command. But, there is no support to export only the dev-
   dependencies. This script is a workaround & quick-solution to this
   problem.  It can export the dev-dependencies to a requirements-dev.txt
   file. Usage: ``` $ peodd -o requirements-dev.txt ```
