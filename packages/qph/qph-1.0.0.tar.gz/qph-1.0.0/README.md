# QPH (Quick Python to HTML)

- Unlike the [Jinja Templating Engine](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) you can write pure Python in HTML

- Easy to use; all you have to do is write "{$qph ***code goes here*** $}" in a HTML file and you can write pure python code

- Helper functions; if you use the function "html_print" you can write html code in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
