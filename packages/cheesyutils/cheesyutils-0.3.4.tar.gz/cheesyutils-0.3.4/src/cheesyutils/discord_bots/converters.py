    """Converter to serve as input validation for ranged integers

    The range can be specified as a minimum and maximum, as well as
    only a minimum or only a maximum. Not supplying one or both
    a minimum or a maximum will raise `ValueError`.

    The range specified is check as if the number is between
    a minimum and a maximum *inclusive*.

    This converter is required to be instantiated, such as the following example
    ```py
    @commands.command()
    async def test(self, ctx, integer: RangedInteger(minimum=0, maximum=3)):
        # this will only accept an integer between 0 and 3
        ...
    ```

    Attributes
    ----------
    minimum : int | None
        The minimum value required.
        If this is `None`, the value provided will only be
        checked against the `maximum`.
    maximum : int | None
        The maximum value required.
        If this is `None`, the value provided will only be
        checked against the `minimum`.
    
    Raises
    ------
    `RangedConstraintFailure` if the argument did not satisfy the range supplied.
