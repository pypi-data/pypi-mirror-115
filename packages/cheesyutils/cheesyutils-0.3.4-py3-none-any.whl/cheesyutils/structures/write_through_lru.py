    """Class for implementing an LRU write-through cache policy

    This class inherits from `cachetools.LRUCache`.

    This class acts morseo as an interface rather than as a functional implementation.
    This expects that child classes implement their own logic for the write-through part
    of the cache policy. The `on_write`, `on_miss`, and `on_evict` abstract coroutines are
    designated for this purpose.

    The `on_write` coroutine is called whenever a cache entry is written and/or updated.
    The `on_miss` coroutine is called whenever a cache miss occurs at a particular key.
    And the `on_evict` coroutine is called whenever a cache entry is evicted at a particular key.

    Attributes
    ----------
    loop : `asyncio.AbstractEventLoop`
        The event loop to use. This is required in order to dispatch
        the `on_write`, `on_miss`, and `on_evict` events.
