Description: # BiT
        
        BiT is a novel approach capable of quantifying a complex system of diverse patterns through 
        species diversity and richness, and taxonomic distinctiveness. 
        It considers an image as a species ecosystem and computes species diversity and richness measures, 
        and taxonomic indices to describe the texture. 
        BiT takes advantage of ecological patterns' invariance characteristics to build a permutation, rotation, and translation invariant descriptor. 
        Experiments on different datasets have shown that BiT texture descriptor has advantages over several texture descriptors and deep methods. 
        
        More details can be found in our paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06997
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following to install:
        ```python
        pip install Bitdesc
        ```
        
        ## Developing BiT
        
        To install BiT, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following in your virtualenv:
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .[dev]
        ```
        ## How to use BiT 
        
        After the installation, the library should be used following the example underneath:
        
        ```python
        import ClassBit
        path = './resources/test.png'
        bit = ClassBit.BiT(path, bfeat=True, tfeat=True, unsharpfilter=False, crimminsfilter=False, normalization=False)
        features = bit.features()
        ```
        The class BiT accepts the following parameters:
        ```python
        path: the path to the image file
        bfeat= biodiversity indices (True, False). It returns 28 features (7 for R, 7 for G, 7 for B, and 7 for RGB)  
        tfeat= taxonomic indices (True, False) It returns 28 features (7 for R, 7 for G, 7 for B, and 7 for RGB)
        unsharpfilter= applies UnsharpMask onto R, G, B channels (True, False) 
        crimminsfilter= applies crimmins filter onto RGB - original image - (True, False) 
        normalization= normalize the array (divide the array by its algebraic norm)
        ``` 
        Not that at least one type of features should be true, that is, (bfeat=False, tfeat=True) or (bfeat=True, tfeat=False) or (bfeat=True, tfeat=True).
        It may be recommended to not normalize should you use need to standardize the dataset before training. 
        
        ### BiT features regardless of channels splitting
        In case you would like to extract features regardless of channels splitting, please consider the following example:
        ```python
        import Taxonomic as taxo
        import Biodiversity as bio
        # OR
        from Bit import taxonomy, biodiversity, bio_taxo
        import cv2
        def main() :
            path = 'test.png'
            img = cv2.imread(path)
            img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)  
            # biodiversity returns an array of 7 values - biodiversity indices only   
            bio = biodiversity(img) #bio = bio(img)
            print(bio)    
            # taxonomy returns an array of 7 values - taxonomic indices only
            taxo = taxonomy(img) #taxo = taxonomy(img)
            print(taxo)
            # bio_taxo returns an array of 14 values - concatenation of biodiversity and taxonomic indices 
            bio_tax = bio_taxo(img)
            print(bio_tax)
        
        if __name__ == "__main__" :
            main()
        
        
        ```
