Robotframework-MongoDB-Library
==============================

A library for interacting with MongoDB from RobotFramework.

Uses pymongo.

Notes
-----

This is a fork from the library [Robotframework-MongoDB-Library](https://github.com/robotframework-thailand/robotframework-mongodb-library.git)

main change is that the json string parsing will be modified to bson loads method, 
this way all bson functions like (ObjectId, Timestamps ....etc ) will be supported directly without any needs to explicitly parse using bson in robot framwork
