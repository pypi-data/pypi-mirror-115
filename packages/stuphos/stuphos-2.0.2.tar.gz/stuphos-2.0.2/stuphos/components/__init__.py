# system:
#	The only reason this exists is to have application and then
#	we have a place for language (which are all components).

# 	<other components>

# 	runtime:
#		When you load the runtime, it provides a way to represent
#		the boot core modules to the application.  The actual game
#		compartment determines how to utilize those boot routines.
