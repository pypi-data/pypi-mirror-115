PyArgos
=======

PyArgos is a Python library for easier interfacing with Argos, a GNOME extension that allows you to create other GNOME Shell extensions.

At the time of creating this repository, the [fork by mwilck](https://github.com/mwilck/argos) is the most up-to-date and compatible with the latest versions
of GNOME.

Requirements
------

- Argos ([original](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos) or [updated fork](https://github.com/mwilck/argos), whichever works best)
- Python >=3.9

Installation
------

Installing this library is extremely easy as it is available over at PyPi, so you just need to `pip install` it:

```bash
pip install pyargos
```

Example usage
