# DBS3-Client

The **Data Bookkeeping Service 3** (DBS 3) provides an improved event data catalog for Monte Carlo and recorded data of the CMS experiment. It provides the necessary information used for tracking datasets, for example the data processing history, files and runs associated with a given dataset, and much more.

DBS 3 has been completely re-designed and re-implemented in Python on the basis of a CherryPy based environment for developing RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web services, which is commonly used within the data management and workload management (DMWM) group of CMS. DBS 3 is using the Java Script Object Notation (JSON) dataformat for interchanging information and Oracle as database backend.


# 1. Install Python

In this first part we are going to install Python 3 and pip. We are going to follow the following [tutorial](https://thelazylog.com/install-python-as-local-user-on-linux/) in the next sections.

## 1.1 Installation of Python 3.8.2

We are going to install Python 3.6.5.
*Note : You can download any version higher that 3.6.0 instead.*

    mkdir ~/python
    cd ~/python
    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/Python-3.8.2.tgz
    tar zxfv Python-3.8.2.tgz
    find ~/python -type d | xargs chmod 0755
    cd Python-3.8.2
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python

If you  get an "No acceptable C compiler found in $PATH" error while running the last command, it mean that python could not find gcc. Please then run the following  command:
- Redhat base:
`yum groupinstall "Development Tools"`
- Debian base:
`apt-get install build-essential`

Solution found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19816275/python-no-acceptable-c-compiler-found-in-path-when-installing-python).  You will then be able to redo the previous command.

## 1.2 Installation of pip

Pypi (Python Package Index) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. In other word, Pypi is where most libraries are stored and updated. Anyone can download any library on Pypi and upload his own library. To get a library from Pypi we need pip. Two way to install pip. You can find the official tutorial [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### a. ensurepip

Python comes with an [`ensurepip`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#module-ensurepip "(in Python v3.9)") [module](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#python), which can install pip in a Python environment.
- Linux/MacOS:
`python -m ensurepip --upgrade`
- Windows:
`py -m ensurepip --upgrade`

### b. get-pip

This is a Python script that uses some bootstrapping logic to install pip.
-   Download the script, from  [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
-   Open a terminal/command prompt,  `cd`  to the folder containing the  `get-pip.py`  file and run:
-- Linux/MacOS:
`python get-pip.py`
-- Windows:
`py get-pip.py`

### c. Changing pip version

If you already have an old version of pip3 or you need to change the version of your pip, You can run the next command (we are getting the 21.2.2 version in the next example):

    export PATH=$HOME/python/bin:$PATH
	pip3 install pip==21.2.2

## 1.3 Ensure python and pip are installed

To ensure that python and pip are installed we are going to run the `which` command.
The following command:

    which python

Should return:

> ~/python/Python-3.8.2/python

We are going to do the same thing for pip:

    which pip

Which should return:

> ~/.local/bin/pip

We can also check their versions:

    python --version
    pip --version

Be sure to have a **python** version higher than **3.6.0** (version 3.8.2 is recommanded) and **pip** version higher than **21.0.0**.

## 1.4 Download of libcurl

To use libcurl, is highly recommanded to use linux or MacOS.
Dbs3-client use pycurl, which requires libcurl. We will see in this section how to get libcurl. Run the following command:
- Redhat base:
`sudo yum install libcurl-devel`
- Debian base:
`sudo apt-get install libcurl-devel`

## 1.5 Download DBS3-Client from pypi

You now have **python3** and **pip** installed. You are finally able to download libraries from pypi.
On pypi you will be able to find [dbs3-client](https://pypi.org/project/dbs3-client/).

### a. Download dbs3-client

As any library on pypi, you can download dbs3-client using the following command:

    pip install dbs3-client

If you need a specific **version** of it, you can precise the version wanted like the following example (getting the 3.17.0 version of dbs3-client):

    pip install dbs3-client==3.17.0

### b. Dependencies

Dbs3-client have 2 python dependencies.
| Dependency's name | Pypi link | version |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| dbs3-pycurl       | [dbs3-pycurl · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dbs3-pycurl/) | 3.17.0 |
|pycurl| [pycurl · PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycurl/) |7.19.3|
