Description: # FRANe
        
        Unsupervised Feature Ranking via Attribute Networks (FRANe)
        converts a dataset into a network (graph) with
        
        - nodes that correspond to the features in the data,
        - undirected edges whose weights are proportional to the similarity
          between the two corresponding features.
        
        PageRank algorithm is than used to compute the centrality of the nodes
        (features) and the computed scores are interpreted as feature importance
        scores.

        # Examplary Code Snippet
        The FRANe method is implemented in Python3.
        The implementation requires some standard scientific libraries
        (e.g., numpy and scipy) that make the implementation efficient.
        
        The method is easy to use:
        
        ```
        import frane
        import numpy as np
        
        x = np.random.random((100,1000))
        r = frane.FRANe()
        r.fit(x)
        scores = r.feature_importances_
        print(scores)
        
        ```
        
        See `examples` for more examples. To run tests, please try `pytest ./tests/*`
