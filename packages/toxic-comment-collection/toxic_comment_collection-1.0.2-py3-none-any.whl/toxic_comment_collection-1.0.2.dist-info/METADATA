# Data Integration for Toxic Comment Classification: Making More Than 40 Datasets Easily Accessible in One Unified Format

This repository contains the code of our paper [**Data Integration for Toxic Comment Classification:
Making More Than 40 Datasets Easily Accessible in One Unified Format**](https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/naumann/people/risch/risch2021data.pdf)  accepted for publication at this year's ACL workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH).

We present a collection of more than 40 datasets in the form of a software tool that automatizes downloading and processing of the data and presents them in a unified data format that also offers a mapping of compatible class labels.
Another advantage of that tool is that it gives an overview of properties of available datasets, such as different languages, platforms, and class labels to make it easier to select suitable training and test data for toxic comment classification.

## Setup
- Clone this repository and install via `pip install .`
```
git clone git@github.com:julian-risch/toxic-comment-collection.git
cd toxic-comment-collection
pip install .
```

## Usage
- Download individual datasets with the `get_dataset()` method into tab-separated files. A list of datasets is at the [bottom of this web page](https://github.com/julian-risch/toxic-comment-collection#list-of-datasets-included-in-the-collection).
```
from toxic_comment_collection import get_dataset
get_dataset('basile2019')
```

- It's as simple as that. You can now work with the dataset, for example, with pandas
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("./files/basile2019/basile2019en.csv", sep="\t")
df.head()
```
```
   id                                               text    labels
0   0  Hurray, saving us $$$ in so many ways @potus @...  ['hate']
1   1  Why would young fighting age men be the vast m...  ['hate']

3   3  NY Times: 'Nearly All White' States Pose 'an A...        []
4   4  Orban in Brussels: European leaders are ignori...        []
```
- Some datasets require Twitter API credentials to be downloaded.
Enter your Twitter API credentials in a file `api_config.json` with the followoing format. You can store that in a directory of your choice. For this example, it's stored in `./src/toxic_comment_collection/api_config.json`.

  ```json
  {
    "twitter": {
      "consumer_key": "",
      "consumer_secret": "",
      "access_token": "",
      "access_token_secret": ""
    }
  }
  ```

- After filling out `api_config.json`, the `get_dataset()` method can use it as input:
```
get_dataset('albadi2018', api_config_path='./src/toxic_comment_collection/api_config.json')
df = pd.read_csv("./files/albadi2018/albadi2018ar_train.csv", sep="\t")
df.head()
```
```
   id                                               text    labels
0   0  مؤسسة أرشيف المغرب تتسلم وثائق عن ذاكرة اليهود...  ['none']
1   1  مفتي السعودية حماس إرهابية وقتال اليهود حرام ش...  ['none']
2   2      أمراء ال سعود اليهود يخوضون حربا عن الصهيونيه  ['hate']
3   3  تحميل كتاب مقارنة الأديان: اليهودية تأليف أحمد...   ['none']
4   4  #هزه_ارضيه_في_جده\n\nهذه هيه الهزه الحقيقيه وت...  ['hate']
```

- All datasets can be downloaded automatically, which will take some time. To respect rate limits of the Twitter API, the program might sleep for several minutes and then continue automatically.
```
from toxic_comment_collection import get_all_datasets
get_all_datasets(api_config_path='./src/toxic_comment_collection/api_config.json')
```

- After downloading all datasets, they can be combined into one large tab-separated file. To this end, the file `./src/toxic_comment_collection/config.json` defines the mappings of different labels to a common subset as described in our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2021.woah-1.17/). You can download it [here](https://github.com/julian-risch/toxic-comment-collection/blob/main/src/toxic_comment_collection/config.json), as it is part of this GitHub repository. The resulting combined file is stored in `./files/combined.tsv`. Note that we skip downloading all datasets in the following command assuming you have already downloaded them:
```
get_all_datasets(config_path="./src/toxic_comment_collection/config.json", skip_download=True, api_config_path='./src/toxic_comment_collection/api_config.json')
```

- A summary of all downloaded datasets can be generated with the `generate_statistics()` method:
```
from toxic_comment_collection import generate_statistics
generate_statistics('./files')
```

- It creates a file called `statistics.txt`:
```
######################
# Overall Statistics #
######################

rows:       812094
file size:  241226068
labels:

    title = "Data Integration for Toxic Comment Classification: Making More Than 40 Datasets Easily Accessible in One Unified Format",
    author = "Risch, Julian and Schmidt, Philipp and Krestel, Ralf",
    booktitle = "Proceedings of the Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH)",

    doi = "10.18653/v1/2021.woah-1.17",

    }

## Add a New Dataset
- Create a new file in the ```datasets``` folder with the following naming scheme:
  ```
  <paper_author><paper_year><suffix (for duplicate file names)>.py
  ```
- Complete the content of the file like in the following example:
  ```python
  import os
  from . import dataset
  from . import helpers
  
  class Mubarak2017aljazeera(dataset.Dataset):

      name = "mubarak2017aljazeera"
      url = "http://alt.qcri.org/~hmubarak/offensive/AJCommentsClassification-CF.xlsx"
      hash = "afa00e36ff5492c1bbdd42a0e4979886f40d00f1aa5517807a957e22fb517670"
      files = [
          {
              "name": "mubarak2017ar_aljazeera.csv",
              "language": "ar",
              "type": "training",
              "platform": "twitter"
          }
      ]
      comment = """Annotation Meaning
                    0 NORMAL_LANGUAGE
                   -1 OFFENSIVE_LANGUAGE
                   -2 OBSCENE_LANGUAGE"""

      license = """ """
  ```

- Overwrite the methods ```process``` and ```unify_row``` from the parent class (```dataset.Dataset```) to implement unpack and process the downloaded files. You might use methods from ```datasets/helpers.py```
- The resulting ```.csv``` should have the following columns:
  - id (added automatically)
  - text
  - labels
- Add the newly created file and class to ```datasets/helpers.py```. (```import``` + ```get_datasets()``` method.)
- Run the following command and answer everything with "n" to update ```config.json```:
  ```
  python main.py --genconfig
  ```
- We are happy to adopt your changes. Just create a pull request from your fork to this repository.
