This utility helps you deploy your code as an API locally on your machine
using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). It is a python based package that can be installed via
pip.


## Quickstart

1. Install rio: `pip install rio-chopt`

2. Deploy your package : `rio deploy -l path/to/package/folder`

    eg: `rio deploy -l /Users/abcdef@ghi.com/Documents/git/myProject`

    Note: you will be prompted to enter your **docker hub username, password, and email**
    
You can find a sample project [here.](https://github.com/chainopt/rio-cli/tree/main/samples/myProject)

#### - Deploy Package Arguments and Options

`rio deploy -l path/to/package/folder`

* `-l` is for local deployment (only local is available for now).
* `-n` is for specifying a package name. If left out, the folder name is chosen as package name.
* `-p` is a port you specify for it to be spun up on(The valid range is 1024-65535). If left out, a port will be
  assigned.
* `-q` is to deploy with no extra prompts to affirm redeployments and no webpage opening when finishing the deployment.

#### - Re-deploying a package.
`rio deploy -l path/to/package/folder`

#### If you used a custom name for your package, you will have to specify it with the package name (-n) flag just like you did initially.



e.g. `rio deploy -l /Users/abcdef@ghi.com/Documents/git/myUpdatedProject`
or

`rio deploy -l -n myCustomName /Users/abcdef@ghi.com/Documents/git/myUpdatedProject`

>Note: It will re-use the port from the first deployment.
