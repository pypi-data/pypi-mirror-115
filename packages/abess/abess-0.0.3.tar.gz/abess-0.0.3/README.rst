**abess** (Adaptive BEst Subset Selection) aims to find a small subset of predictors such
that the resulting linear model is expected to have the most desirable
prediction accuracy. This project implements a polynomial algorithm proposed to solve these problems. It supports:

-  various model:
-  linear regression
-  classification (binary or multi-class)
-  counting-response modeling
-  censored-response modeling
-  multi-response modeling (multi-tasks learning)
-  sure independence screening
-  nuisance penalized regression

Quick Start
============

You can install the newest version of abess from
`pypi <https://pypi.org>`__ with:

.. code-block:: console

    $pip install abess

Import abess in a Python project:

.. code-block:: console

    import abess
