`dt-cli` is currently in **ALPHA**. But it's evolving quickly with new
features for extension development and cluster management to be added soon.

### Features

* Build and sign extensions from source
* Generate development certificates for extension signing
* Generate CA certificates for development

## Installation

```shell
pip install dt-cli
```

## Usage

Currently there are three basic commands available for working with extensions.
Extension subcommand has two aliases for convenience: `dt ext` or `dt extensions`.

* `dt extension genca`

  generates CA root certificate and key, required to generate developer certificates
  and for extension validation. The file containing the certificate (`ca.cert` is
  the deafult name) needs to be placed on ActiveGates and monitored hosts that will
  be executing extensions.

  ```shell
  Usage: dt extension genca [OPTIONS]

    creates CA key and certificate, needed to create developer certificate
    used for extension signing

    Options:
    --ca-cert TEXT  CA certificate. Default: ./ca.crt
    --ca-key TEXT   CA key. Default: ./ca.key
    -h, --help      Show this message and exit.
  ```

* `dt extension gendevcert`

  generates a developer certificate used for signing extensions. Please note that
  there may be multiple developer certificates coming from a single root
  certificate. It's up to your organization to manage them.

  ```shell
  Usage: dt extension gendevcert [OPTIONS]

    creates developer key and certificate used for extension signing

    Options:
    --ca-cert TEXT   CA certificate. Default: ./ca.crt
    --ca-key TEXT    CA key. Default: ./ca.key
    --dev-cert TEXT  Developer certificate. Default: ./developer.crt
    --dev-key TEXT   Developer key. Default: ./developer.key
    -h, --help       Show this message and exit.
  ```

* `dt extension build`
  builds distributable extension file from a given directory containing extension files
  (`./extension` by default). The extension will be signed with a developer certificate and key.

  ```shell
  Usage: dt extension build [OPTIONS]

    builds extension file from the given extension directory (extension in
    current dir. is the default)

    Options:
    --extension-directory TEXT  Directory where extension files are. Default:
                                ./extension

    --target-directory TEXT     Directory where extension package should be
                                written. Default: .

    --certificate TEXT          Certificate used for signing. Default:
                                ./developer.crt

    --private-key TEXT          Private key used for signing. Default:
                                ./developer.key

    --keep-intermediate-files   Do not delete the signature and 'extension.zip'
                                files after building extension archive

    -h, --help                  Show this message and exit.
  ```


## Using dt-cli from your Python code

You may want to use some commands implemented by `dt-cli` directly in your Python code, e.g. to automatically sign your extension in a CI environment.
Here's an example of building an extension programatically, it assumes `dtcli` package is already installed and available in your working environment.


```python
from dtcli import building


building.build_extension(
    extension_dir_path = './extension',
    extension_zip_path = './extension.zip',
    extension_zip_sig_path = './extension.zip.sig',
    target_dir_path = './dist',
    certificate_file_path = './developer.crt',
    private_key_file_path = './developer.key',
    keep_intermediate_files=False,
)
```
