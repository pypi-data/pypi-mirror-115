Description: # yotpo API
        This is a package to integrate and model the data
        structure and wrap the api calls made to use the
        yotpo api.
        
        ## Install
        ```shell
        pip install yotpo-api
        ```
        ## Usage
        ### Authentication
        To use the [yotpo api](https://apidocs.yotpo.com/reference) you need to provide
        your yotpo **api key** and **api secret** either by passing them as kwargs to
        the client init
        ```pyhton
        client = YotpoClient(api_token, api_secret)
        ```
        either by setting them as env vars named **YOTPO_API_TOKEN** and **YOTPO_API_SECRET**
        so they are automatically used by the client when there kwargs are not provided.
        ```python
        client = YotpoClient()
        ```
        ### Getting reviews
        ```python
        client.get_reviews()
        ```
        optionally providing the **product id** and the **from date** params.
        
        ### Creating reviews
        ```python
        client.create_review(
                {
                    "product_title": "product_title",
                    "product_url": "https://www.sephora.com/something",
                    "display_name": "John Doe",
                    "email": "jone.dow@gmail.com",
                    "review_content": "the fragrance is good, even thou the texture got worse, anyway, still great value.",
                    "review_title": "great value",
                    "review_score": 5,
                }
            )
        ```
