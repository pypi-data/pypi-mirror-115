## :pray: Motivation

DeepSurv is a Cox Proportional Hazards deep neural network used for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness. It was originally proposed by [Katzman et. al (2018)](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1) and [implemented in Theano (using Lasagne)](https://github.com/jaredleekatzman/DeepSurv).

Unfortunately, [Theano is no longer supported](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/theano-users/7Poq8BZutbY/rNCIfvAEAwAJ). There have been some attempts in recreating DeepSurv in other DL platforms, such as [czifan's `DeepSurv.pytorch`](https://github.com/czifan/DeepSurv.pytorch). However, given its popularity and ease of use, I think TensorFlow 2's Keras is a great option for this task.

[mexchy1000 created `DeepSurv_Keras`](https://github.com/mexchy1000/DeepSurv_Keras). However, it is a very raw prototype: it is not properly documented nor validated. Moreover, it is not being actively supported anymore. Therefore, I used it as a rough starting point for the development of DeepSurvK.

This is my first Python package. I am sure there are many places where it could be improved. Feedback is always welcome!

## :tada: Features
* Implemented using Keras (using TensorFlow 2)
* Includes the original datasets together with a proper description of the variables
* Designed with data as pandas DataFrames in mind
* Visualization tools for the most common plots for fast and easy exploration and prototyping
* Treatment recommender
* (Basic) hyperparameter optimization using grid and randomized search

## :bookmark_tabs: Documentation
You can find the complete package's documentation [here](https://deepsurvk.readthedocs.io). Unfortunately, I haven't had as much time as I would like to work on it. Alternatively, I strongly recommend you take look at the [example notebooks](https://github.com/arturomoncadatorres/deepsurvk/tree/master/examples).
