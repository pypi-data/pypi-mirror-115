## About

TBlock is a free and open-source ad-blocker, written in Python. It uses the [hosts file](https://codeberg.org/tblock/tblock/wiki/FAQ) to block advertising and tracking domains, which means it protects your whole system against these domains. TBlock is compatible [with most of filter formats](docs/FILTER_SYNTAX_SUPPORTED.md), and also has [a built-in filter converter](https://codeberg.org/tblock/tblock/wiki/How-to-use-the-converter), to help you share your custom filters with people that are using different ad-blockers. 

## Features

+ Free and open-source software
+ Easy to install
+ Does not cost any money
+ Does not track your personal data
+ Does not make you fingerprintable, unlike some ad-blocking browser extensions
+ Fast rules parsing
+ Blocks ads for your whole operating system
+ Compatible with most filter formats
+ Has an [online filter repository](https://codeberg.org/tblock/tblock/wiki/Remote-filters-repository) to help you find and subscribe to filters in an easier way
+ Has a built-in filter converter

## Installation

There are various methods to install TBlock. You need to install TBlock as root, since superuser privileges are required to edit the hosts file.

### With python

This is the fastest and easiest way to install TBlock on your machine. Simply run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo pip install tblock
```

### Other installation methods

More installation methods can be found on our website:

[![More installation methods](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20it-now-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)](https://tblock.codeberg.page/install)

### Manually

To build TBlock manually, see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).

## Post-installation

After the installation and after each update of TBlock, you should update your local version of the remote filter repository and subscribe to a blocking filter, by running:
```shell
$ sudo tblock -Sy tblock-base
```
