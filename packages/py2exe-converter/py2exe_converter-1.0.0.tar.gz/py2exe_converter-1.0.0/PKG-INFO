Description: The package allows users (linux) to convert python scripts into executable files by simply using the py2exe-converter -f <python-file-name.py>. 
            One can also use another option after entering python filename which is -p for packages to be included into the executable file. -p takes requirement.txt as input. I have included an example in the demo folder as well. Enjoy! And yup, please, do come forward if you think you can improve or add more functionalities to the project :). 
            Lastly, a huge shoutout to pyinstaller developers who made such an incredible solution that provided a solid base to this project. Thanks amigos!
