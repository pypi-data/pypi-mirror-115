Volumes, Persistent storage

Volumes are storage units which you can attach them to your instances (virtual machines). it usually a good idea
to not to use your instance's root volume for storing important information.

Examples:

# Creating a SSD volume named box1 with 10GB size
$ digicloud volume create box1 --type SSD --size 10

# Listing current volumes
$ digicloud volume list

# Checking the details of a volume
$ digicloud volume show box1

# Attaching a volume to an instance(virtual machine)
$ digicloud volume attach box1 --instance some_instance_name

# Detaching a volume from an instance
$ digicloud volume detach box1 --instance some_instance_name

# Deleting a volume
$ digicloud volume delete box1

# Remember deleting a volume is a destructive operation, you can't undo that
# that's why we always ask if you are sure, you can bypass this confirmation using:
$ digicloud volume delete box1 --i-am-sure
