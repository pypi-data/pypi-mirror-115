``pibooth-sound-effects`` is a plugin for the `pibooth <https://github.com/pibooth/pibooth>`_
application.

It adds sound effects to the application:

- When pressing on the first menu --> click
- When selecting a layout --> click
- During the countdown --> countdown
- When entering the "thank you" menu --> applause

Sounds can be customized (see below).

Install
-------

::

    $ pip3 install pibooth-sound-effects

Configuration
-------------

Here below the new configuration options available in the `pibooth`_ configuration.
**The keys and their default values are automatically added to your configuration
after first** `pibooth`_ **restart.**

.. code-block:: ini

    [SOUNDS]

    # Path to the sounds folder
    sounds_path = ~/.config/pibooth/sounds

.. note:: Edit the configuration by running the command ``pibooth --config``.

Customize sounds
----------------

Sound files shall be ``.wav`` and have the name of the state in which it shall be played (e.g. {state}.wav).
If you want to play the sound in loop, just add "_loop" in the name (e.g. {state}_loop.wav).

For example at the ``print`` level:
- if it exists, the sound named ``print.wav`` will be played once, when entering the state
- if it exists, the sound named ``print_loop.wav`` will be played in loop until the state is left.

Custom sounds can be added by adding or replacing existing sound files of the sounds folder
(by default ``~/.config/pibooth/sounds``) with custom ones.

Specific features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to the standard ``{state}.wav`` and ``{state_loop}.wav`` states, other sound files are accepted in ``preview`` state:

- if you have a preview sound (``preview.wav`` file), then it will play when entering the state,
- if you want to play the same sound for each time of the countdown, name it as ``preview_countdown.wav``,
- if you want to play different sounds for each time of the countdown, simply add corresponding files in the sound folder (e.g.: ``3.wav``, ``2.wav``, ``1.wav``)

  .. note::  These specific sounds are cut to be 1 second long, and if some are missing, it will be replaced either by ``preview_countdown.wav`` (if it exists) or one second of silence.
