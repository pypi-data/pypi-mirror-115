CST geometry manager
====================

It's a package that allows you to model geometries contain wires and
then export it into CST Microwave Studio project using python.

Features
--------

-  One file format for all wire geometries
-  Сreating a CST project directly from a script or notebook.
-  Convenient data structure for creating your own unique complex
   geometries from wires

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    # Path to CST DESIGN ENVIRONMENT.exe
    path_to_CST_DE = "Absolute\Path\To\CST DESIGN ENVIRONMENT.exe"


    def circular_geometry_equal_wires(length, number_of_wires, radius):
        lengths = [length for i in range(number_of_wires)]

        circular_geometry = simple_geometries.get_circular_geometry(
            radius=radius, lengths_of_wires=lengths
        )
        return circular_geometry


    circular_geometry = circular_geometry_equal_wires(2, 4, 4)
    circular_geometry.create_cst_project(
        name='circular_geometry',
        path_to_CST_DE=path_to_CST_DE
    )

This code creates simple geometry contain 4 wires equally distributed on
imaginary cylinder. Then ``create_cst_project`` method creates project.
To start using scripts firstly need to change ``path_to_CST_DE``
variable. CST project create in cst\_project folder.

During using scripts or notebooks for creating projects all the CST Microwave studio windows must be closed

Examples
--------

Several examples located in notebooks folder.
``make_geometries_example.ipynb`` shows how create sinmple geometries
using ``Wire`` and ``Geometry`` classes. ``export_to_cst_example.ipynb``
shows how create a CST project using jupyter notebook. In ``examples``
also located a script shows how create a CST project without using
jupyter notebook.
